> An Android Application that provides the details of current value of all kind of harvest to the farmer

## Objectives
- The purpose of the proposed system is to design an Android application that
provides the details of current value of all kind of harvest to the farmer.
- The farmer would know the current market-value of the harvest by sitting at
his home.
- The dealer will put the crop name along with its value on this app, and
Farmer will decide where to invest his harvest.

## Problem Definition

1. In India, there are farmers, who hold less than 2 hector of land. They are
85% of the total operational holdings and 44 % of the total operated area.
Because of the small size, they can’t afford the modern machinery to
increase productivity.
  - Due to their small productivity they couldn’t reach out to the major
market places.

2. Farmers in India sell food grains like small retailer. There is not much profit
from the crop they grow. In some cases, large wholesale dealers buy food
grain when the price is low and sell when the price is high. So, famers lose a
huge profit.
  - There is not much food storage facility. A huge amount of food grains
are wasted due to bad warehouse or in availability of warehouse.
This is the reason that Farmer couldn’t get the actual value of their
crop and eventually they lose their own profit.

3. Exploitation by the middleman is the reason put forth for not getting the best
price for the crop of the agriculturists.
  - The government should promote the plan like “Farmers Market”,
where the farmers can directly sell their crop at reasonable price to the
consumers.
  - Agricultural marketing still continues to be in a bad shape in rural
India. In the absence of sound marketing facilities, the farmers have to
depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their
farm produce which is sold at throw-away price.
